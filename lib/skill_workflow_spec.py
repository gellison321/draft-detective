"""The workflow declaration a skill may carry in its SKILL.md frontmatter.

A skill under ``skills/`` can become a Draft Detective assessment on its own by
carrying a ``metadata.draft_detective`` block in its YAML frontmatter. This
module owns that block: the schema, how it is read from a skill file, and how
the workflow slug is derived. It deliberately imports nothing from the
workflow machinery so that lightweight callers (the eval task discovery, tests)
can read specs without pulling in LangGraph.

Frontmatter shape, with every accepted field (only ``title`` and ``category``
are required; the values shown for the others are their defaults unless the
comment says otherwise)::

    ---
    name: active-voice
    description: Use this skill to ...        # what the agent reads when picking skills
    metadata:
      draft_detective:
        title: Active Voice & Clear Actors    # required; name in the assessment picker
        category: language                   # required; a slug from lib/workflows/categories.py
        description: Does your prose ...      # picker text; defaults to the skill description
        type: active_voice                    # WorkflowRunType slug; defaults to name with _ for -
        experimental: true                    # hidden unless the user opts into alpha checks
        icon: pen-line                        # lucide icon name; defaults to the frontend's fallback
        view_images: false                    # let the agent look at the document's images
        web_search: false                     # give the agent web search (gates on user consent)
        reasoning_effort: medium              # low | medium | high; defaults to the agent's default
        propose_edits: false                  # let issues carry verbatim-quote text replacements
        presets: []                           # slugs from lib/workflows/presets.py this check belongs to
        required_dependencies: [document_processing]
    ---

The block lives under ``metadata`` because the Agent Skills format reserves
that key for host-specific data: other runtimes that install the skill ignore
it, so the skill stays portable.
