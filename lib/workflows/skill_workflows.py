"""Workflows declared entirely by a skill file.

A skill whose SKILL.md frontmatter carries a ``metadata.draft_detective``
block (see ``lib/skill_workflow_spec.py``) becomes a ``SimpleDeepAgentManifest``
here, with no ``manifest.py``, registry import, or category entry of its own.
The registry calls ``discover_skill_workflows()`` after registering the
hand-written manifests.

The skill's ``WorkflowRunType`` member is added at import time as well, by
``lib/workflows/models.py`` reading the same declarations, so the enum's
hand-written members stay static while skill-declared ones need no line there.

Only skill-backed single-pass checks go through this path. Workflows with their
own graphs keep their explicit manifests.
