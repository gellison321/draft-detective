"""Assessment presets: named sets of workflows the picker can select in one go.

A preset is for a group of people who always run the same checks, such as an
editorial department, so nobody has to remember which of a dozen assessments
are theirs. Picking a preset replaces the selection with its set; the picker
shows the preset as active while the selection matches it.

Hand-written workflows join a preset by being listed here. A skill-declared
workflow names its presets in its frontmatter (``presets: [editorial_review]``)
and is appended to them by ``lib/services/workflow_types.py``, so adding a
skill to a department's set needs no code change.

To reorder presets: change the order of entries in WORKFLOW_PRESETS. Workflows
within a preset are shown in picker order regardless of the order here.
